I couldn't explain everything in the video but I made sure to add many commments in methods that do the biggest jobs,
you will find these methods in Flight, Aircraft, Airline, Airport, User, City classes.
Catalog classes is where I store the data, it can be flights, users, aircrafts etc...
The console acts as a controller.
